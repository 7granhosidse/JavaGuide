## What is Dua Masura?
  
Dua Masura is also known as Dua Qunoot or Dua al-Qunoot. The word Qunoot means to stand or to be obedient. Dua Qunoot is a prayer that expresses one's devotion and submission to Allah. It is a prayer that praises Allah, seeks His help, guidance, mercy, forgiveness, and protection from all kinds of evils.
  
Dua Masura is one of the most comprehensive and powerful prayers in Islam. It covers various aspects of one's faith, worship, and worldly affairs. It is a prayer that acknowledges one's sins and shortcomings, and asks Allah to pardon them. It is a prayer that seeks refuge from Allah from the four major trials that every human being will face: the torment of the grave, the trial of the Antichrist, the afflictions of life and death, and the evil of what He has created.
  
Dua Masura is based on several authentic hadiths that narrate how the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught this prayer to his companions. One of them is reported by Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:

> The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "When you finish the last tashahhud, you should seek refuge with Allah from four things: from the torment of Hell-fire; from the torment of the grave; from the trial of life and death; and from the evil of the trial of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal (the Antichrist)." Then he would recite: "Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min 'adhabi jahannam wa min 'adhabil-qabr wa min fitnatil-mahya wal-mamat wa min sharri fitnatil-masihid-dajjal (O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the torment of Hell-fire; from the torment of the grave; from the trial of life and death; and from the evil of the trial of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal)." (Bukhari)

## How to Recite Dua Masura?
  
Dua Masura is recited after the last tashahhud in every obligatory and voluntary prayer. It is recited silently by oneself, except in the Witr prayer where it is recited aloud by the Imam or by oneself if praying alone.
  
To recite dua masura correctly, one should follow these steps:
  
1. After finishing the last tashahhud, one should say: "Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammadin wa 'ala ali Muhammadin kama sallaita 'ala Ibrahima wa 'ala ali Ibrahima innaka Hamidun Majid. Allahumma barik 'ala Muhammadin wa 'ala ali Muhammadin kama barakta 'ala Ibrahima wa 'ala ali Ibrahima innaka Hamidun Majid (O Allah! Bestow Your blessings upon Muhammad and upon his family as You have bestowed Your blessings upon Ibrahim and upon his family. You are indeed Praiseworthy, Glorious. O Allah! Bless Muhammad and his family as You have blessed Ibrahim and his family. You are indeed Praiseworthy, Glorious)." This is known as sending salutations upon the Prophet (peace be upon him).
