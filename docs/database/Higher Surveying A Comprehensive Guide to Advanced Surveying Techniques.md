Higher Surveying by Juny Pilapil La Putt is a 493-page book that was published by Baguio Research and Publishing Center in 1986. It is based on the author's experience as a professor of civil engineering and surveying at the University of the Philippines. The book is designed to help students, teachers, and practitioners of surveying to gain a deeper understanding of the principles and methods of higher surveying.
 
In this book, you will learn about:
 
- The fundamentals of geodesy, including the shape and size of the earth, geodetic datums, geodetic coordinates, map projections, and geodetic computations.
- The basics of photogrammetry, including the types and characteristics of aerial photographs, stereoscopy, photogrammetric instruments, aerial triangulation, and photogrammetric mapping.
- The principles and techniques of satellite surveying, including the satellite orbits, satellite signals, satellite positioning systems, satellite observations, and satellite mapping.
- The methods and applications of hydrographic surveying, including the tides and currents, sounding methods, hydrographic instruments, hydrographic computations, and hydrographic charts.

Higher Surveying by Juny Pilapil La Putt is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the advanced aspects of surveying. It is a comprehensive guide that covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of higher surveying. It is also a useful reference for professionals who are involved in surveying projects that require higher accuracy and precision.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
Higher surveying is a branch of surveying that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth's surface and its gravity field. Higher surveying is also known as geodetic surveying or geomatics. Higher surveying is different from lower surveying or plane surveying, which assumes that the earth is flat and ignores the effects of curvature and gravity.
 
Higher surveying is important for various applications, such as mapping large areas, establishing national and international boundaries, determining geodetic positions and heights, monitoring crustal movements and deformations, studying the earth's shape and gravity field, and supporting navigation and geospatial information systems.
 
Higher surveying requires the use of sophisticated instruments and methods, such as satellite positioning systems, aerial photography, laser scanning, digital image processing, geographic information systems, and computer software. Higher surveying also requires the knowledge of advanced mathematics, physics, astronomy, geodesy, photogrammetry, and cartography.
